I am so young but don,t judge my skill based on my age🐣. I have a passion for programming👨‍💻. I have started programming when I am 17 years old . I spent most of creating wonderful projects which comes to my minds🤯. Sometimes it's so frustrating😫 when things were not working as you planned but I don,t gave the habit of giving up once I started something🌟. The plus point about me is that I am a very quick learner and I love to learn new things😄. I am not the type of guy who is afraid to try new things. I love exporting new thing that's why current I am exploring rust, Elixer(Phonex framework).I am good at Django and python compared to others because I have spent lots of time with it😀
